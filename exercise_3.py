# EXERCISE 3

# Create a list of xmas gifts using cool control flow

# Tasks
# User stories
# As a user, I want to be able to add items to the list, so I can read it later.
# As a user, I want to be able to keep adding things to the list until I use exit
# As as user, I should be able to use the word exit in a sentence and still have the program terminate, so that anyone can use it
# As a user, when the program exits, I want to see the complete list in caps lock and numbered, so that I know what to buy. Example: <br/>
#  1 - RC car <br/>
#  2 - PS2 <br/>
#  3 - GTA Vice City
# Hint: while loops and break conditions, use list and append, iterate to print
