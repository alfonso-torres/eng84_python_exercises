# PYTHON EXERCISES

## <u>Exercise 1: Calculate year of birth</u>

*Tasks*:
- Define the variables `name` and `age`.
- Calculate the year they were born.
- Print out `"OMG <person>, you are <age> years old so you were born in <year>"` with the correct values.

*Second part*:

- Prompt the user for input and re-assign the variable `name` and `age`.
- Find out if the person's birthday has already happened this year or not.

*Extra*:

- Go look into the library time.
- Print out the amount of hour this person has lived.

*Acceptance Criteria*:

- Program defines the variable age and name.
- Program prints the string `"OMG <person>, you are <age> years old so you were born in <year>"`

## <u>Exercise 2: Restaurant Waiter Helper program</u>
We are going to make a program that helps a waiter with his menu and his orders.

*Tasks*: <br/>
User stories
- As a User I want to be able to see the menu in a formated way, so that I can order my meal.
- As a User I want to be able to order 3 times, and have my responses added to a list so they aren't forgotten.
- As a user, I want to have my order read back to me in formated way so I know what I ordered.

*Acceptance Criteria*:

- Its own project on your laptop and Github.
- Be git tracked.
- Have 5 commits minimum!
- Have documentation.
- Follows best practices.

## <u>Exercise 3: Xmas Holiday List that never ends!</u>
You have learned about for loops. Time to use that, plus a while loop to keep
going. Your task is to create a list of xmas gifts using cool control
flow now!

*Tasks*: <br/>
User stories
- As a user, I want to be able to add items to the list, so I can read it later.
- As a user, I want to be able to keep adding things to the list until I use exit
- As as user, I should be able to use the word exit in a sentence and still have the program terminate, so that anyone can use it 
- As a user, when the program exits, I want to see the complete list in caps lock and numbered, so that I know what to buy. Example: <br/>
  1 - RC car <br/>
  2 - PS2 <br/>
  3 - GTA Vice City
- Hint: while loops and break conditions, use list and append, iterate to print.  

*Acceptance Criteria*:

- All user stories are completed.
- Has documentation.

## <u>Exercise 4: Fizz Buzz!</u>
Super simple game that will substitute multiples of 3 and 5 for Fizz and
Buzz respectively, or Fizzbuzz for multiples of the both. 

*Tasks*:
- Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
- For multiples of three print `Fizz` instead of the number.
- For the multiples of five print `Buzz` instead of the number.
- For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print `FizzBuzz`.

*Extra*:
- Make a new fizzbuzz file and make it functional, so we can decide
which numbers to substitute for fizz and buzz using functions.
- Hint: loop, range, control flow.  
  
*Acceptance Criteria*:
- All core task are done.
- Code compiles without error.

## <u>Exercise 5: Functional Calculator</u>
Amazing you now know functions, lets make a functional calculator.

*Tasks*:
- Create an `add` function.
- Create a `subtract` function.
- Crate a `multiply` function.
- Create a `divide` function.
- Create an `area of a circle` function.
- Create an `area of a square` function.
- Create an `area of a triangle` function.

*Extra*:
- Run the function with arguments.
- Assert against known values - for example adding 10 + 30 will always be 40.
- Hint: do one function at a time and use my structure for the running the functions.
  
*Acceptance Criteria*:
- All core functions done.
- Separation of concerns if followed.
- DRY code and functions.

## <u>Exercise 6: Loops and lists</u>
Let's loop over some list!

*Tasks*:
- Make a loop with a range that says hello 10 times.
- Create another loop with a range that asks for names and appends to list_names.
- Make a loop that iterates over each name in list_names and format's so that each name
  is lowercase, then add these names to a new list called list_names_lower.
- Iterate over the list of values to find if they are even or not.

*Acceptance Criteria*:
- All tasks have been done.
